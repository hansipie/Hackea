Rules:
- Only include what you can actually see on this page. Leave out empty fields.
- Hardware kinds: dowel, cam bolt, cam lock, screw, nail, shelf pin, bolt, leg bolt, hinge, knob, handle, wall bracket, felt pad, plate, other.
- For steps, say plainly where things go: on top, underneath, left, right, front or back, and which parts touch.
- Read part sizes from any dimension lines or numbers printed next to the drawings.
- If the photo shows the box or the finished product rather than a page, use kind "cover", and describe its shape in product.type, like "low media stand with two shelves and a vertical divider, about 70 cm wide".`;

Fields:
- name: the product name as printed. brand: the maker. variant: a short plain description. size: outer size in centimetres.
- difficulty: 1, 2 or 3. people: 2 only if a step really needs a second person.
- archetype: the closest of shelf, drawers, table, bed, cabinet, seat, sofa. It is only a backup.

Geometry, read this carefully:
- Units are millimetres.
- One entry per physical piece. Two identical side panels are two entries with different ids and the same label.
- size is [width, height, depth] of the piece as it sits in the FINISHED product. A side panel 18 thick, 660 tall and 400 deep is [18, 660, 400]. A top is [664, 18, 400].
- pos is the centre of the piece in the finished product. y is the height above the floor, x runs left to right seen from the front, z runs from the back (negative) to the front (positive). The product is centred on x = 0 and z = 0 and stands on y = 0.
- Pieces that are joined touch face to face exactly, with no gap and no overlap. Do the arithmetic for every piece: if sides 18 thick stand at x = -341 and x = 341, their inner faces are at -332 and 332, so a top that fits between them is 664 wide.
- Legs, rails, slats and rods are boxes too. Use "shape": "cyl" for round ones, with size [diameter, length, diameter] when upright or [length, diameter, diameter] when lying along x.
- materials: board (particleboard, MDF, plywood), fiber (thin hardboard backs and drawer bottoms), wood (solid wood, legs, slats), metal, soft (cushions, mattresses).
- Leave out hardware and packaging. At most 60 parts. If there are many identical slats, keep up to 12.

Steps:
- Follow the manual's own order. Write each title as one short instruction, under 60 characters. detail is one or two short sentences. Never use em dashes or en dashes.
- add lists the ids of pieces that join the product in that step. Every piece is added exactly once, in the first step that uses it.
- fix lists the hardware used in that step and how many. kind is one of: dowel, camScrew (cam bolt or connecting screw), cam (cam lock disc), screw, nail, pin (shelf pin), bolt (allen bolt or machine screw), legScrew (double ended leg bolt), hinge, knob, handle, bracket (wall fixing), glide (felt pad), plate. Use "to" with the ids it goes into when the manual makes that clear. Add len and dia in mm when they are printed.
- pose is how the product lies while you work: upright, upside_down, on_back (front facing up), face_down (back facing up), on_left_side, on_right_side.
- tools: allen, screwdriver, flathead, hammer, drill, wrench, level, tape, pencil, knife.
- warnings: two (needs two people), floor (work on a soft surface), loose (don't fully tighten yet), hand (hand tight only), wall (fix it to the wall), tip (can tip over), square (check it is square), face (mind which way the finished side faces).
- Usually 6 to 20 steps.

If you only have the cover or a photo of the product, design the most typical assembly for that exact product, with the usual pieces, hardware and steps for its shape and size, and set "fromCover": true.
